# Architecture Deep Dive

## Components

### Data Lake (S3)
**Landing Area:** Raw data ingestion point
- Format: CSV, JSON, Parquet
- Retention: [X days]
- Access: S3 API and bulk transfers from source systems

**Cleansed/Enriched Layer:** Transformed data
- Data quality checks applied
- PII masked
- Standardized schemas

**Analytics/Reporting Layer:** Business-ready data
- Optimized for query patterns
- Pre-aggregated metrics
- Partitioned for performance

### Data Processing
**AWS Glue:** 
- Purpose: Serverless ETL orchestration
- Jobs: Data cleaning, transformation, validation
- Trigger: Scheduled and event-based

**AWS Lambda:**
- Purpose: Event-driven processing
- Use cases: Lightweight transformations, data validation triggers

### Data Access
**Athena:** Interactive SQL queries on S3
**Redshift (Optional):** Data warehouse for complex analytics
**Qlik:** BI and visualization layer

### Security & Governance
- IAM roles and policies
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit)
- AWS Glue Data Catalog for metadata management
- CloudWatch for auditing and monitoring

## Data Flow
1. Source systems → S3 Landing Area (via S3 API/bulk)
2. AWS Glue ETL → Cleansing & Transformation
3. Data Catalog → Metadata management
4. Cleansed data → S3 Cleansed Layer
5. Analytics queries → Athena/Redshift
6. Reporting → Qlik dashboards
7. Monitoring → CloudWatch alerts
